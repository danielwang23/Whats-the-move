The fun\\, it seems\\, is contagious\\, as her artwork is greeted with enthusiasm and support at local galleries\\, art shows\\, and online. She refers to her work as \u201chappy art\u201d and she is excited to be able to share both the art and the happiness! \\nYounger\u2019s artwork consists of paintings and collages\\, many pieces containing elements of both. She enjoys learning about the lives of other artists and experimenting with their techniques\\, as well. Her subjects are illustrated with simple figures\\, including a wide array of people and animals enjoying life. The artist seeks out souvenirs and ephemera related to a theme for constructing her collages and enhancing her paintings. \\nThe current show focusing on the songs of The Beatles is made up of forty pieces meant to trigger a memory or a smile from viewers who appreciate the music of the \u201cFab Four.\u201d Each piece represents a song. Like many of her generation\\, Barbara Younger admires the band\u2019s whimsical lyrics and musical innovations. She finds that more recent generations enjoy the songs as much as she does\\, so she hopes everyone will feel a spark of happiness in the show. \\nBarbara Younger invites everyone to join her for conversation and a little Beatlemania at the Hillsborough Visitors Center on Saturday\\, September 14\\, 2024\\, from 2:00 pm to 4:00 pm. \\nExhibition artwork is available for purchase directly through Mike\u2019s Art Truck.

Help us honor veterans and active-duty soldiers by writing heartfelt letters of appreciation.\nWe will use this opportunity to inform the student population and broader community about the critical issues facing veterans today through UNC's Army ROTC cadets. Currently, there are 16.2 million veterans in the United States; of those, 2.1 million are homeless, 2 million suffer from PTSD, and 1.7 million struggle to access adequate healthcare. Through letter-writing, we are fostering a personal connection between our community and the veterans who continue to face these challenges in a system that often falls short in providing them the support they deserve.\nWe'll also have donuts for sale, with all proceeds going toward covering the shipping costs needed to deliver these letters to veterans and soldiers. Your participation helps bring a little bit of home to those who serve.\n\n\n      From Monday, November 4, 2024 12:00 PM\n      to 2:30 PM EST\n      at Pit.\n    \n\n",

        "Description": "\nLectures in Art History: Emmanuel Ortega, University of Illinois at Chicago\n\u201cBeyond European Palettes: The Overlooked Contributions of Indigenized Artists in the Historiography of Painting in Mexico\u201d\nIn this talk, Emmanuel Ortega analyzes the genealogy of the nomenclature involved in art history\u2019s considerations of indigenized forms of art and the erasure of over five hundred years of influence to better articulate the processes that minoritized Native peoples suffered throughout the colonial period. Understanding the history of Spanish colonial art and its byproducts in Mexican culture requires reconsideration of almost two centuries of scholarly questions that have exacerbated art\u2019s role as an agent of Mexican social stratification. The entanglement between empire and art history, he proposes, exhorts us to implicate the cultural interlocutors that exemplify such divisions.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nEmmanuel Ortega is a Curator, the Marilynn Thoma Scholar and Assistant Professor in Art of the Spanish Americas at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), and a Scholar in Residence at the Newberry Library (2023\u20132024). Ortega has lectured nationally and internationally on nineteenth-century Mexican landscape painting, ex-votos, and visual representations of the New Mexico Pueblo peoples in Novohispanic Franciscan martyr paintings. His recently curated art show titled \"Contemporary Ex-Votos Devotion Beyond Medium\" produced an accompanying catalog published by the New Mexico State University Art Museum this spring. An essay titled \u201cBeyond European Palettes: The Overlooked Contributions of Indigenized Artists in the Historiography of Painting in Mexico.\u201d will appear this fall as part of the Routledge Companion\u00a0to Art and Empire: Aesthetics and Imperialism, 1800-1950. His book Visualizing Franciscan Anxiety and the Distortion of Native Resistance: The Domesticating Mission is under contract with Routledge.\u00a0\nThis lecture is co-sponsored by the Institute for the Study of the Americas and the Department of Romance Languages.\nA weeknight or daytime permit is now required after 5:00 pm on weekdays. No permit is needed from 5:00 pm Friday through 7:30 am Monday. A $1.00 one-night pass is available in selected lots.

Free vegan treats will be provided to session participants.\u00a0All are welcome!The main session runs from 7-8 P.M. Participants are welcome to stay (from 8-8:30 P.M.) after the main session, to enjoy some snacks and interact with other particiapnts.Notes:You do not need to RSVP to attend!\u00a0We only use the RSVP headcount as an estimate so we know how much food to bring (+ so we can have extras for everyone).You do not need a yoga mat (this is not physical exercise).

Don\u2019t worry if you\u2019ve never danced before because this is geared toward absolute beginners. All you need is a pair of socks and yourself!\n\u00a0\nTuesday Lessons:\u00a0These lessons focus on learning to dance with another individual and the basics of moving around the social dance floor. We alternate styles on Tuesday each week, beginning with Latin dancing such as cha-cha, rumba, and swing and switching to smooth, which is more the waltz and tango dances. The lesson goes from 7 to 8 p.m., and we leave time for dancers to practice social dancing on their own from 8 to 9 p.m.\n\u00a0\nWednesday Lessons: The Wednesday lessons will begin with a Latin-style dance lesson from 7 to 8 p.m. and a standard-style lesson from 8 to 9 p.m. These lessons focus more on technique and learning how to move your body. They will be beginner-friendly but get a little bit harder as time goes on. \nAfter the dues deadline (9/27), they are members-only, so please make sure to talk to a council member if you want to try it out!\n\u00a0\nGetting In Touch:\u00a0If you're interested in learning more about the team, you can email us at ycguan@ad.unc.edu or join our listserv here:\u00a0https://forms.gle/i1VADq7u4jaEZU7P9\n\n\n      From Tuesday, November 5, 2024 7:00 PM\n      to 8:00 PM EST\n      at Woollen Room B019.\n    \n\n",

We alternate styles on Tuesday each week, beginning with Latin dancing such as cha-cha, rumba, and swing and switching to smooth, which is more the waltz and tango dances. The lesson goes from 7 to 8 p.m., and we leave time for dancers to practice social dancing on their own from 8 to 9 p.m.\n\u00a0\nWednesday Lessons: The Wednesday lessons will begin with a Latin-style dance lesson from 7 to 8 p.m. and a standard-style lesson from 8 to 9 p.m. These lessons focus more on technique and learning how to move your body. They will be beginner-friendly but get a little bit harder as time goes on. \nAfter the dues deadline (9/27), they are members-only, so please make sure to talk to a council member if you want to try it out!\n\u00a0\nGetting In Touch:\u00a0If you're interested in learning more about the team, you can email us at ycguan@ad.unc.edu or join our listserv here:\u00a0https://forms.gle/i1VADq7u4jaEZU7P9\n\n\n      From Wednesday, November 6, 2024 7:00 PM\n      to 8:00 PM EST\n      at Woollen Room B019.\n    \n\n",

        "Description": "\nCACE Late Night \nStudents step into the shoes of various global factions, to learn about different regions of the world, military strategy, diplomacy, and more. Using various wargames, including those developed for the French Ministry of Defense and the US Marines, students will analyze possible near-future military and diplomatic scenarios around the world to learn about geopolitics, culture, along with the complex relationships and history that exist in our complex world.\u00a0They must make strategic and tactical decisions that are roughly in line with what different parties could or would do in actual military or diplomatic scenarios. They must use their knowledge of military strategy, politics, and tactics to make real-time decisions that will affect the battlefield and global politics. This is a unique opportunity beyond what most (or possibly any) courses here at UNC offer for students to put themselves in the shoes of a military commander, defense minister, prime minister, or head of state. It is an opportunity to apply much of what they have learned in class and to use a real-life tool that militaries around the world utilize.\u00a0\nBy bringing together ROTC Cadets and those interested in working in politics, economics, policy, and development, we are bridging an important gap. In allowing our future military and civilian leaders to understand how the other thinks, we strive for a more robust, interconnected, and effective national security apparatus, with nuanced cultural, historical, and strategic understanding for a more humane and effective foreign policy\u2014all starting here, at UNC.\u00a0\n\n\n      From Friday, November 8, 2024 5:00 PM\n      to 7:00 PM EST\n      at UNC Naval Armory.\n    \n\n",

Free vegan treats will be provided to session participants.\u00a0All are welcome!The main session runs from 7-8 P.M.

        "Link": "https://heellife.unc.edu/event/10591150",
        "Description": "\nTrent Masiki Talk \"Race, Music, and Mysticism in When the Spirits Dance Mambo and Bird of Paradise: How I Became Latina\"\nIn his award-winning book,\u00a0The Afro-Latino Memoir: Race, Ethnicity, and Literary Interculturalism, Trent Masiki examines understudied African American influences in Afro-Latino life writing published after the advent of the Black Arts Movement. In this talk, Masiki discusses how Dr. Marta Moreno Vega and Raquel Cepeda center African American cultural icons and new religious movements, respectively, in their memoirs. In\u00a0When the Spirits Dance Mambo: Growing Up Nuyorican in El Barrio\u00a0(2004), Vega represents Afro-Latino and African American interculturalism through her fusion of Katherine Dunham with La Dominadora. Dunham, the famous African American choreographer, was one of the many African American celebrities whom Vega, as a young person, idolized from a distance. La Dominadora, in contrast, was one of the many spirit guides represented close at hand, on Vega\u2019s grandmother\u2019s Santerismo altar. Like Vega, Raquel Cepeda was also fascinated by elements of African American culture in her youth. Cepeda was aligned in spirit, if not in practice, with the cultural separatist pole of Black nationalism. In her memoir\u00a0Bird of Paradise: How I Became Latina\u00a0(2013), Cepeda describes her attraction to the theosophy of the Five Percent Nation (FPN), a splinter sect of the Nation of Islam. In addition to FPN mysticism, Cepeda evinces a generic belief in kismet,\u00a0gilgul neshamot, and the gods and spirit guides of Afro-Hispanic Caribbean religious practices. Cepeda\u2019s conviction in the supernatural is equally matched by her faith in the scientific. Cepeda\u2019s promotion of genetic profiling in general and of a specific genetic profiling company, in particular, entices scholars to interrogate the privacy ramifications of a cross-promotional marketing strategy that genetically targets communities of Afroethnic descent. Masiki argues that the representation of Katherine Dunham in Vega\u2019s memoir and the FPN in Cepeda\u2019s reveals the significance of the African American presence in Afro-Latina identity formation and highlights the commensurability between Latino, Afro-Latino, and African American studies.\n\u00a0\nDr. Trent Masiki is the Director of Black Studies and Asst. Prof. of English at Suffolk University. He earned his PhD and MA in Afro-American studies from the University of Massachusetts-Amherst. In addition to his degrees in Afro-American studies, he also has an MFA in Creative Writing, an MA in English, and a BS in Computer Science. His research focuses on African American literature and culture and as well as African Americans\u2019 intercultural influences on and connections with other peoples of African descent in the US and the global African diaspora. His first book,\u00a0The Afro-Latino Memoir: Race, Ethnicity, and Literary Interculturalism\u00a0(University of North Carolina Press 2023), won the 2024 Anna Julia Cooper and C.L.R. James Award for Outstanding Scholarly Publication in Africana Studies. The award was bestowed by the National Council for Black Studies.\n\n\n      From Tuesday, November 12, 2024 4:30 PM\n      to 6:00 PM EST\n      at Online.\n    \n\n",

We alternate styles on Tuesday each week, beginning with Latin dancing such as cha-cha, rumba, and swing and switching to smooth, which is more the waltz and tango dances. The lesson goes from 7 to 8 p.m., and we leave time for dancers to practice social dancing on their own from 8 to 9 p.m.\n\u00a0\nWednesday Lessons: The Wednesday lessons will begin with a Latin-style dance lesson from 7 to 8 p.m. and a standard-style lesson from 8 to 9 p.m. These lessons focus more on technique and learning how to move your body. They will be beginner-friendly but get a little bit harder as time goes on. \nAfter the dues deadline (9/27), they are members-only, so please make sure to talk to a council member if you want to try it out!\n\u00a0\nGetting In Touch:\u00a0If you're interested in learning more about the team, you can email us at ycguan@ad.unc.edu or join our listserv here:\u00a0https://forms.gle/i1VADq7u4jaEZU7P9\n\n\n      From Tuesday, November 12, 2024 7:00 PM\n      to 8:00 PM EST\n      at Woollen Room B019.\n    \n\n",

This event will take place on Thursday, November 14th at 6:00PM.\u00a0\nTimmons-Goodson\u2019s professional career in North Carolina represents more than three decades of unflinching and powerfully effective public service.\nTimmons-Goodson earned a Bachelor of Arts from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1976, a Juris Doctor from its School of Law in 1979, and a Master of Judicial Studies in 2014 from Duke University School of Law.\nTimmons-Goodson currently serves as the Dean and Chief Academic Officer of North Carolina Central University School of Law. After serving as a prosecutor, legal aid lawyer, trial and intermediate appellate judge, Timmons-Goodson was appointed to the Supreme Court of North Carolina by Governor Michael Easley. She will always be due special notice in the history books as the fourth woman and the first African American woman to sit on North Carolina\u2019s highest court.\u00a0 She served twenty-eight years in the judiciary prior to her retirement from the Supreme Court in 2012.\nIn July 2014, President Barack Obama appointed Timmons-Goodson a member of the United States Commission on Civil Rights and later designated her Vice Chair.\u00a0 The independent, bipartisan, fact-finding federal agency is charged with informing the development of national civil rights policy and enhancing federal enforcement of national civil rights laws.\nPresident Obama further demonstrated his confidence in Timmons-Goodson by nominating her to serve as an Article III judge in the Eastern District of North Carolina. Though she was denied the necessary Senate hearings, her family remains justly proud of the nomination.\nIn recognition of her service to her alma mater and State of North Carolina, Timmons-Goodson has received among other awards the UNC-Chapel Hill General Alumni Association Distinguished Alumni and Harvey Beach Awards, the William R. Davie Award, and the UNC School of Law Distinguished Alumna Award.\u00a0 She holds honorary degrees from Johnson C. Smith University, St. Augustine\u2019s College, and UNC-Chapel Hill.\n\n\n      From Tuesday, November 12, 2024 6:30 PM\n      to 8:30 PM EST\n      at Stone Center Auditorium .\n    \n\n",

Don\u2019t worry if you\u2019ve never danced before because this is geared toward absolute beginners. All you need is a pair of socks and yourself!\n\u00a0\nTuesday Lessons:\u00a0These lessons focus on learning to dance with another individual and the basics of moving around the social dance floor. We alternate styles on Tuesday each week, beginning with Latin dancing such as cha-cha, rumba, and swing and switching to smooth, which is more the waltz and tango dances. The lesson goes from 7 to 8 p.m., and we leave time for dancers to practice social dancing on their own from 8 to 9 p.m.\n\u00a0\nWednesday Lessons: The Wednesday lessons will begin with a Latin-style dance lesson from 7 to 8 p.m. and a standard-style lesson from 8 to 9 p.m. These lessons focus more on technique and learning how to move your body. They will be beginner-friendly but get a little bit harder as time goes on. \nAfter the dues deadline (9/27), they are members-only, so please make sure to talk to a council member if you want to try it out!\n\u00a0\nGetting In Touch:\u00a0If you're interested in learning more about the team, you can email us at ycguan@ad.unc.edu or join our listserv here:\u00a0https://forms.gle/i1VADq7u4jaEZU7P9\n\n\n      From Wednesday, November 13, 2024 7:00 PM\n      to 8:00 PM EST\n      at Woollen Room B019.\n    \n\n",

These cities were linked by their simultaneous boom in the 1560s and 1570s following China\u2019s lift of the maritime trade ban and Spain\u2019s initiation of the Galleon trade. The study examines how this trans-Pacific globalization shaped daily life and urban development, while also causing conflicts on a state and imperial level.\nThe transformation of these cities, driven by the expansion of commerce and the influx of immigrants bringing new ideas and technologies, is reflected in the material changes to their urban landscapes. New fortifications such as castles, city walls, and watchtowers were built in all three cities, along with innovative market formats and businesses. Religious architecture and artifacts also displayed cross-cultural influences. Despite the strong commercial and cultural links between China and the Spanish empire, mutual suspicions persisted among officials. The history of city transformations revealed that early modern globalization could not be seen as a singular, uniform process; rather, it consisted of multiple \u201cglobes\u201d that intersected with the urban residents and immigrants of varying port cities.\nProf. Xiaolin Duan\u00a0is\u00a0a Professor of Chinese history in the Department of History at North Carolina State University. Duan studies socio-cultural history in medieval and early modern China, particularly urban history, popular religion, and visual/material culture.\nShe is the author of articles and book chapters on topics ranging from the cultural geography and visual culture in premodern China to early modern China-New Spain silk trade. She also published journal articles on historical pedagogical research and translated various works in pre-modern and modern Chinese history and art history. She has also contributed to digital humanities and K-12 education projects, including History for 21st Century, OER World History project, Chinese Text, and the Getty Center project \u201cSeattle Art Museum Online Catalog of Chinese Painting and Calligraphy.\u201d\n\n\n      From Thursday, November 14, 2024 5:30 PM\n      to 7:00 PM EST\n      at FedEx Global Education Center, Rm. 1005.\n    \n\n",

Social media content creators are shaping the media landscape in unprecedented ways, often serving as influential figures in lifestyle, culture, and entertainment. However, as content creators increasingly engage in political discourse, the dynamics of their authority shift. In \"Experience vs. Expertise: Authenticity, Authority, and Gender in Social Media Communication\", Marie He\u0159manov\u00e1 will delve into how content creators establish themselves as credible voices on polarized issues, leveraging both \"expertise\" and personal \"experience.\"\n\nHe\u0159manov\u00e1 will highlight the intricate balance content creators must maintain between portraying themselves as authentic individuals while also claiming authority. Drawing from ethnographic research in Central Europe, He\u0159manov\u00e1 will share insights from two case studies: the spread of COVID-19 conspiracy theories within feminized spaces on Instagram, and the representation of the Russian invasion of Ukraine by young TikTok creators.\nThrough these examples, Marie will illustrate how gender shapes the communicative practices of content creators, affecting their engagement with geopolitical crises and broader political debates.\n\n\n      From Friday, November 15, 2024 3:00 PM\n      to 4:00 PM EST\n      at Freedom Forum Conference Center.\n    \n\n",

        "Description": "\nThe Crossing: What Belongs to Me\nDonald Nally, conductor\nExperience\u00a0what belongs to me, a kaleidoscope of styles and ideas. Movements of David Lang\u2019s\u00a0poor hymnal\u00a0bookend a program that features music written for the choir by former Carolina Performing Arts artist-in-residence, Shara Nova. The music reflects her focus on making the world a better place through our actions and art. Ayanna Woods\u2019\u00a0Infinite Body, begins with a consideration of capitalism\u2019s effects on our bodies and develops into a glaring affirmation of love:\u00a0\n\u00a0\nMy love, our time\non earth is made\nof sunlight\u2014and you,\nbeaming at me\ngolden.\n\u00a0\nAnd, Gabriela Ortiz\u2019s raucous, exhilarating\u00a0Tierra Parte 1, questions, with hope, the Earth\u2019s ability to forgive us.\u00a0\nThe thread is Shara\u2019s music. Movements from her magnum opus\u00a0Titration\u00a0explore our trauma, grief, and the role of our vagal nerve in moving from anger, through imagination, to calmness. Shara\u2019s final work,\u00a0Resolve,\u00a0is an unfettered riff on what\u2019s possible, urging in profoundly rich, driving music: \u201cBe not discouraged, do not fall into numbness. Resolve to increase your discomfort, and thus attain a calm body. Be curious of one another. Reap the reward, truth.\u201d\u00a0\nTicket purchase required; more information here:\u00a0https://tickets.carolinaperformingarts.org/events\n\n\n      From Friday, November 15, 2024 8:00 PM\n      to 10:00 PM EST\n      at The Chapel of the Cross.\n    \n\n",

This season\u2019s programming features music of female composers and their artistic circles. The name \u201cGut Instinct\u201d is a play on words. In 19th-century Europe, the violin, viola, and cello were strung with (sheep) gut.\u00a0All of the artists collaborating with the Pleyel and Graf pianos at UNC-Chapel Hill (built in 19th-century Paris and Vienna, respectively) use these gut string materials.\nThe turn of phrase \u201cgut instinct\u201d also refers to the visceral, accessible nature of the musical performances that the artists will be presenting. We want to make \u201cHistorically Informed Performance\u201d accessible, relatable, and culturally relevant! We also want to feature these special pianos that are rarely heard by the public, along with great music by female composers which has remained lesser known to the greater public for far too long!\n\n\n      From Sunday, November 17, 2024 7:30 PM\n      to 9:00 PM EST\n      at Person Hall .\n    \n\n",

In this project, Dr. Wang examines four societies\u2014Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and mainland China\u2014each with distinctive economic and political characteristics to explore the common factors driving their fertility decline. Approaching the issue from a feminist perspective, the project analyzes how Confucian cultural roots intersect with modern economic development models, leading to a \u201cliberation mismatch.\u201d Young women in these societies, while ideologically and educationally empowered, remain structurally constrained, pushing many to opt out of traditional lifestyles, including marriage and childbearing, in pursuit of personal ambitions. Contrary to the assumption that low fertility is a consequence of women\u2019s liberation, this project argues that it may instead result from insufficient or incomplete liberation, where ideological freedom is not matched by structural support.\nProf. Ting Wang\u00a0is assistant professor of Sociology at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, where she also has an appointment in Gender Studies. Her research approach combines both quantitative and qualitative methodologies to delve into gender disparities in criminal offending, victimization, and the processes within the criminal justice system across the United States, China, and the global landscape.\n\n\n      From Wednesday, November 20, 2024 3:00 PM\n      to 5:00 PM EST\n      at University Room, Hyde Hall.\n    \n\n",

Don\u2019t worry if you\u2019ve never danced before because this is geared toward absolute beginners.

We alternate styles on Tuesday each week, beginning with Latin dancing such as cha-cha, rumba, and swing and switching to smooth, which is more the waltz and tango dances. The lesson goes from 7 to 8 p.m., and we leave time for dancers to practice social dancing on their own from 8 to 9 p.m.\n\u00a0\nWednesday Lessons: The Wednesday lessons will begin with a Latin-style dance lesson from 7 to 8 p.m. and a standard-style lesson from 8 to 9 p.m. These lessons focus more on technique and learning how to move your body. They will be beginner-friendly but get a little bit harder as time goes on. \nAfter the dues deadline (9/27), they are members-only, so please make sure to talk to a council member if you want to try it out!\n\u00a0\nGetting In Touch:\u00a0If you're interested in learning more about the team, you can email us at ycguan@ad.unc.edu or join our listserv here:\u00a0https://forms.gle/i1VADq7u4jaEZU7P9\n\n\n      From Wednesday, November 20, 2024 7:00 PM\n      to 8:00 PM EST\n      at Woollen Room B019.\n    \n\n",

This will be Silkroad\u2019s fifth performance in Chapel Hill. Today, under the leadership of\u00a0Artistic Director and former Carolina Performing Arts artist-in-residence, Rhiannon Giddens, Silkroad reaches new heights through a commitment to new music, a mission towards cultural collaboration, and a reinvigorated focus to high-quality arts education.\u00a0\nSilkroad Ensemble\u2019s newest initiative, American Railroad, illuminates the impact of African American, Chinese, Irish, and other immigrant laborers who built the Transcontinental Railroad, and the indigenous communities who were displaced by it. Exploring the dissemination of cultures across the United States, the railroad was to North America what the Silk Road was to China, the Far East, and Europe.\u00a0\u00a0\nThese populations played a fundamental role in one of America\u2019s most important technological and economic achievements of the 19th century \u2013 and shaped its cultural identity \u2013 yet their contributions have all too often been erased from history. This performance will amplify untold stories to paint a richer, more accurate picture of the origins of the American Empire which profoundly reverberate today, and the formation of our multifaceted American identities.\u00a0\nLed by artistic director Rhiannon Giddens, each stop on the\u00a0American Railroad\u00a0tour will contextualize \u2014 or rather re-contextualize \u2014 the railroad through music. Chinese traditional music on the suona and pipa are contrasted with the fiddle and banjo of Black musical traditions, or their Indigenous and Celtic counterparts. These cultural intersections reveal a thread of commonality, despite their varied origins, and remind us of the intricately rich American story.\u00a0\nTicket purchase required; more information here:\u00a0https://tickets.carolinaperformingarts.org/events\n\n\n      From Wednesday, November 20, 2024 7:30 PM\n      to 9:30 PM EST\n      at Memorial Hall.\n    \n\n",

By showing both differences and striking commonalities between the capitalist and socialist system of doing care, this talk sheds light on a new vision about care work that goes beyond the Cold-War paradigm yet without losing careful scrutiny of both the roles of the authoritarian state and capital in transforming gendered social life.\nProf. Yige Dong\u00a0is an Assistant Professor who holds a joint appointment in the Department of Sociology and Criminology and the Department of Global Gender and Sexuality Studies at the State University of New York, Buffalo. Holding a PhD in Sociology, Yige is an interdisciplinary scholar whose research interests include labor, gender, work, political economy, contentious politics, and comparative-historical methods.\nYige is currently working on her first monograph,\u00a0The Fabric of Care: Women\u2019s Work and the Politics of Livelihood in Industrial China, which examines the century-long transformation of care work among the Chinese working-class. In addition, Yige\u2019s articles have appeared in\u00a0International Review of Social History,\u00a0Critical Sociology,\u00a0Critical Asian Studies,\u00a0International Journal of Comparative Sociology, among others.\nYige\u2019s research has received several awards from academic organizations such as the American Council of Learned Societies and the American Sociological Association; and some of her works have been translated into Italian, Hungarian, and Portuguese.\n\n\n      From Thursday, November 21, 2024 4:30 PM\n      to 5:30 PM EST\n      at Pauli Murray Hall, Rm. 569.\n    \n\n",

Don\u2019t worry if you\u2019ve never danced before because this is geared toward absolute beginners. All you need is a pair of socks and yourself!\n\u00a0\nTuesday Lessons:\u00a0These lessons focus on learning to dance with another individual and the basics of moving around the social dance floor. We alternate styles on Tuesday each week, beginning with Latin dancing such as cha-cha, rumba, and swing and switching to smooth, which is more the waltz and tango dances. The lesson goes from 7 to 8 p.m., and we leave time for dancers to practice social dancing on their own from 8 to 9 p.m.\n\u00a0\nWednesday Lessons: The Wednesday lessons will begin with a Latin-style dance lesson from 7 to 8 p.m. and a standard-style lesson from 8 to 9 p.m. These lessons focus more on technique and learning how to move your body. They will be beginner-friendly but get a little bit harder as time goes on. \nAfter the dues deadline (9/27), they are members-only, so please make sure to talk to a council member if you want to try it out!\n\u00a0\nGetting In Touch:\u00a0If you're interested in learning more about the team, you can email us at ycguan@ad.unc.edu or join our listserv here:\u00a0https://forms.gle/i1VADq7u4jaEZU7P9\n\n\n      From Tuesday, November 26, 2024 7:00 PM\n      to 8:00 PM EST\n      at Woollen Room B019.\n    \n\n",

Don\u2019t worry if you\u2019ve never danced before because this is geared toward absolute beginners. All you need is a pair of socks and yourself!\n\u00a0\nTuesday Lessons:\u00a0These lessons focus on learning to dance with another individual and the basics of moving around the social dance floor. We alternate styles on Tuesday each week, beginning with Latin dancing such as cha-cha, rumba, and swing and switching to smooth, which is more the waltz and tango dances. The lesson goes from 7 to 8 p.m., and we leave time for dancers to practice social dancing on their own from 8 to 9 p.m.\n\u00a0\nWednesday Lessons: The Wednesday lessons will begin with a Latin-style dance lesson from 7 to 8 p.m. and a standard-style lesson from 8 to 9 p.m. These lessons focus more on technique and learning how to move your body. They will be beginner-friendly but get a little bit harder as time goes on. \nAfter the dues deadline (9/27), they are members-only, so please make sure to talk to a council member if you want to try it out!\n\u00a0\nGetting In Touch:\u00a0If you're interested in learning more about the team, you can email us at ycguan@ad.unc.edu or join our listserv here:\u00a0https://forms.gle/i1VADq7u4jaEZU7P9\n\n\n      From Tuesday, December 3, 2024 7:00 PM\n      to 8:00 PM EST\n      at Woollen Room B019.\n    \n\n",

Original Yoga practices were made to help one control their thoughts and actions through raising awareness and self-regulation. Yoga from ancient India was originally meant for the mind before it was popularized as a physical activity. The UNC Bhakti Yoga club is working to help students experience these same fulfilling feelings through mindful meditation.\n\n\nThe Bhakti Yoga Club is committed to creating a stress-relieving and welcoming environment. Free vegan treats will be provided to session participants.\u00a0All are welcome!The main session runs from 7-8 P.M. Participants are welcome to stay (from 8-8:30 P.M.) after the main session, to enjoy some snacks and interact with other particiapnts.Notes:You do not need to RSVP to attend!\u00a0We only use the RSVP headcount as an estimate so we know how much food to bring (+ so we can have extras for everyone).You do not need a yoga mat (this is not physical exercise). You are welcome to stay as long as you like during the sessions. You also do not need to have attended previous sessions to show up to an upcoming one. Feel free to come and see how you feel.\n\n\n\n\n      From Monday, January 13, 2025 7:00 PM\n      to 8:00 PM EST\n      at Carolina Student Union #2424.\n    \n\n",

Free vegan treats will be provided to session participants.\u00a0All are welcome!The main session runs from 7-8 P.M. Participants are welcome to stay (from 8-8:30 P.M.) after the main session, to enjoy some snacks and interact with other particiapnts.Notes:You do not need to RSVP to attend!\u00a0We only use the RSVP headcount as an estimate so we know how much food to bring (+ so we can have extras for everyone).You do not need a yoga mat (this is not physical exercise).

This event offers a unique opportunity to gain firsthand insights into the PA program, student life, and the journey toward becoming a healthcare professional. Our panelists will offer advice for prospective students on patient care experiences, shadowing, pre-requisite courses, and more! Whether you're considering applying to the PA program or simply curious about the profession, this session is an excellent chance to ask questions and connect with those who are living the PA experience.\n\u00a0\nThe Carolina Pre-Physician Assistant Association is a student-run organization that focuses on the academic, social, and service interests of pre-PA students at UNC Chapel Hill. Our goals are to educate students on the process of applying to PA programs, support undergraduate students through pre-requisite courses and patient care experiences, and connect students with practicing PAs through shadowing. In the past, we have hosted PA student panels, PA program representative panels, and provided shadowing and volunteer opportunities.\u00a0\n\n\n      From Tuesday, January 28, 2025 7:00 PM\n      to 8:00 PM EST\n      at Online.\n    \n\n",

Original Yoga practices were made to help one control their thoughts and actions through raising awareness and self-regulation. Yoga from ancient India was originally meant for the mind before it was popularized as a physical activity. The UNC Bhakti Yoga club is working to help students experience these same fulfilling feelings through mindful meditation.\n\n\nThe Bhakti Yoga Club is committed to creating a stress-relieving and welcoming environment. Free vegan treats will be provided to session participants.\u00a0All are welcome!The main session runs from 7-8 P.M. Participants are welcome to stay (from 8-8:30 P.M.) after the main session, to enjoy some snacks and interact with other particiapnts.Notes:You do not need to RSVP to attend!\u00a0We only use the RSVP headcount as an estimate so we know how much food to bring (+ so we can have extras for everyone).You do not need a yoga mat (this is not physical exercise). You are welcome to stay as long as you like during the sessions. You also do not need to have attended previous sessions to show up to an upcoming one. Feel free to come and see how you feel.\n\n\n\n\n      From Monday, February 3, 2025 7:00 PM\n      to 8:00 PM EST\n      at Carolina Student Union #2424.\n    \n\n",
